                                <p>SEIAG provides barge and crane services to install rip rap rock of various types and sizes in all coastal locations. This process can be used to control shoreline erosion as the rocks absorb the shocks from the waves instead of the sea wall. MEC also installs rip rap to meet a variety of other needs including environmental requirements for construction.</p>
